# sha256
Some fun with SHA-256

Trying to start with a high level (Python) implementation of SHA-256, checking against FIPS test vectors and pre-existing libraries (mainly OpenSSL). 

Goal is to go from a high level implementation to a working FPGA implementation optimized for Xilinx 7-series boards.
